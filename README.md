# Mobile Computing Project

This project involved creating a location aware application that runs on the android platform.

I decided to create an application that tracks/allows a user to find their favourite places of interest, and then store these along with additional information so that they can be retrieved for viewing later.

I made use of the Android SDK coupled with Googles' Location and Map APIs for the tracking and display of the device's location. For the storage of the locations information, I integrated a real-time database in Googles Firebase which allowed me to populate a list with the user's stored locations.

With the Android SDK, I was also able to work with the devices on-board camera functionality, which allowed me to let the user capture, review and store an image along with the location details provided.

To test this application, you may install the mcp_application.apk that can be found [here](/mcp_application.apk).

You may also opt to watch the provided demos that are accessible from the root directory.
